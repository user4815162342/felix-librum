This directory is used to store data to be imported into the web
application. Specifically, the file 'items.tsv' will be imported by
the import.js script in the directory above.

It is recommended that old data files be stored here by date, and make
'items.tsv' a symlink that points to the current file. Of course, this
is not possible on non-unix-based operating systems.
