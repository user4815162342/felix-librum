# Felix Librum

This is a simple web-based library online catalog, intended for small
libraries (less than about 10,000 books), such as those run by small
schools, churches, businesses, etc. 

The application itself runs in JavaScript on the browser. There's no need for
PHP, or Node.js or any other server scripting languages. So, it's 
compatible with *any* web server that can serve static files.

## Getting Started

This code is currently at beta stage, but should be ready for production.
Installation and set up is pretty straightforward, just copy the `www` folder
into your website, and you're ready to go... except you need data.

To get data into your application, you'll need a CSV file of your book
catalog. Use the "import.js" script under tools to put this into the 
appropriate JSON format for the application. The required fields and
positions are documented in that script.

If you want help with installation, or customization, send me a private
message. Otherwise, if you notice a problem, or have a feature request,
open up an issue.
